Explanation
1. var myHeaders = new Headers();
This line creates a new Headers object. The Headers interface of the Fetch API allows you to create your own headers object to be used with HTTP requests. You can then append custom headers or manipulate existing ones.

> var myHeaders = new Headers();

Headers: This is a built-in browser API that provides a way to create and manage HTTP headers.

myHeaders.append("apikey", "iV45NHXrsS2r7AkIi5URcy7OQ4vKcFad");
This line appends a new header to the Headers object created in the previous step. The append method adds a new header or appends a value to an existing header.
append: A method of the Headers object that takes two arguments:
The name of the header ("apikey" in this case).
The value of the header ("iV45NHXrsS2r7AkIi5URcy7OQ4vKcFad" in this case).
This will result in a header like:

> apikey: iV45NHXrsS2r7AkIi5URcy7OQ4vKcFad

3. var requestOptions = { ... };
This part of the code creates an object called requestOptions which specifies the options to be used when making a fetch request.

var requestOptions = {
  method: 'GET',
  redirect: 'follow',
  headers: myHeaders
};

method: Specifies the HTTP method to be used for the request. In this case, it's 'GET', which means the request will retrieve data from the server.

redirect: Specifies how redirects should be handled. The 'follow' option means that the request will automatically follow HTTP redirects.

redirect: 'follow'

`headers`: Specifies the headers to be sent with the request. Here, it is set to the `myHeaders` object we created earlier, which includes the apikey header.

fetch: This method is used to make an HTTP request. The first argument is the URL to which the request is sent (https://api.example.com/data), and the second argument is the requestOptions object.
.then(response => response.json()): This part handles the response by converting it to JSON format.
.then(result => console.log(result)): This part logs the result to the console.
.catch(error => console.log('error', error)): This part catches any errors that occur during the fetch request and logs them to the console.
